# r_fluid

The purpose of this project is to make starters, understand how the stream processing system works. The following concepts will be covered (will be added)

1. basic API abstraction, including StreamGraph,Operator
2. data parallelism and task parallelism
3. delivery semantics 
4. window computation

The implementation of this system includes some personal thoughts, such as: streaming state store, Data Parallel Actors, etc.

NOTE: This is currently a standalone project.
